Education
=========

**University of Washington**, PhD (ABD), Geography/Demography Current\

**Texas State University**, MS Geography\

**Park University**, BS Computer Information Systems, *summa cum laude*\

Work
====

**The Flatiron School**, Washington, DC\
*Lead Instructor*\

$\textendash$

Guiding career-change-minded students through introductory curriculum in
Data Science with Python.

Delivering content, maintaining student engagement, and providing
real-world context.

**Spatially, Inc**, Boston, Massachusetts\
*Lead Data Scientist*\

$\textendash$

Leading a small team of data scientists who are merging spatial analytic
techniques with traditional machine learning to build leading-edge
location intelligence.

Applying sophisticated machine learning to very large sensor datasets
($10^8$ rows daily) to extract hyper-local behavioral intelligence
(*ensemble learning: random forests, gradient boosting; cluster
analysis*).

Deriving custom data products from multiple layers of public,
first-party, and third-party private datasets.

*Spatializing* very large datasets for efficient product functionality
(*high-volume GIS/mapping data production*).

**Digitas LBi**, Boston, Massachusetts\
*Data Scientist*\

$\textendash$

Logfile analytics ($10^8$ rows daily) of data-at-rest (`AWS`, `Hive`,
`regex`, `R`).

Bid and spend forecasting (*time-series*, *non-parametric regression*).

Kicking off interactive analytics project (Tableau).

**University of Washington**, Seattle, Washington\
*Graduate Research Assistant and Instructor*\

$\textendash$

Built gravity models of interstate migration using very large national
survey data sets (*poisson regression*, `SQL`, `R`).

Built complex GLMs to explain social/contextual effects on migration
probabilities (*difference-in-difference*, *predicted probability
models*).

Taught undergraduate courses as instructor of record (including Intro
Statistics).

**Dell, Inc.**, Austin, Texas\
*Senior Consultant*, Dell Professional Services Oct 2002 -- Aug 2006\

$\textendash$

Turnaround specialist: pulled multiple unprofitable/failing projects
back from the brink.

Delivered profitable engagements representing \$̃5M quarterly revenue.

Built globe-spanning IT infrastructure (LDAP, email, storage, backup and
recovery).

*Manager, Network Systems Engineering*, Dell Information Technology May
2000 -- Sep 2002\

$\textendash$

Integrated multiple, fragmented teams into a cohesive organization
delivering multi-million dollar systems engineering projects with
C-level visibility.

Rewarded high performers, coached the unmotivated, and managed out poor
performers.

Retained top talent, made the team an aspirational organization for
junior level engineers.
