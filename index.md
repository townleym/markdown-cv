## Skills and interests

__Quantitative analytics__

I know how hard it is to get a propensity model for causal analysis to work. I've written my own functions for confusion matrix analysis. Assessing predictive model fit is pretty easy, but getting prediction error within acceptable bounds is often really hard.

I'm learning about reinforcement learning. Empirical science is fun but quantifying uncertainty seems more useful.

__Shaping data__

I'm an old bash hack. Before reformatting as column-major parquet, loading into HDFS I can do some quick exlploration on even pretty big text files using regular expresseion together with the *gnu coreutils* (<div style="font-family:monospace">sed, awk, grep</div>).

__I'm a teacher__

I'm happiest helping other people learn. It's difficult to stand back and watch someone do something differently than I would, or in a way that I think is inefficient, but that tension is where the learning happens.
